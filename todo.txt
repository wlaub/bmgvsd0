registry.py
        take a kwargs and pass it to the constructor with a copy of the kwargs that the entity can store for spawning children or w/e i am like 51% sure this is a good idea that i have, in the past, yearned for.

unfuck render layers
    or maybe just formalize using kwargs to pass stuff to entity creation?

unfuck body/shape management
    Entity.add_body(*args, **kwargs):
        self.app.space.add(*args, **kwargs)
        self.bodies.append((args, kwargs))

    Entity.remove_bodies:
        for args, kwargs in self.bodies:
            self.app.space.remove(*args, **kwargs)

~ do hand hitboxes and equipment pickups
make equipment pickups show a controls popup when active?
    or just turn red?
    maybe the hand moves or blinks?

tune coffeepot spawning

when the camera moves, a spawnolith might spawn out-of-frame, and spawnoliths that are too far away might be forgotten

debug console
    get entity at cursor
    show entity debug logs
        needs timestamps
    etc

figure out the right way to do collision
    need to be able to quickly get any pair of entities that collided

boss 1

camera movement mechanics
    pick up in hand at node
    drop from hand at another node

geographical support conditions
    parameters for controlling spawning by location
    max number of <entity>
    scaling coefficients
    that kind of thing
    tunable parameters used by spawner entities to make
    spawn decisions that vary with position (of the camera)

spawner entities
    spawn enemies when within range of camera
    starting node spawners (and other later) conditional on player having weapon
 

# down the stack:

saving/loading

spawner entity creation mechanics

camera zoom mechanics

lustful ball can be farmed, herded, and then harvested by some other mechanism away from the origin

rooms/transitions

geography persistence mechanics

keyboard controls:
    walk toward mouse if in window
    space for fast walk

graphics

an enemy that can regain health and can get more drops when it takes damage depending on how much damage it has taken
