here be spoilers























































registry.py
        take a kwargs and pass it to the constructor with a copy of the kwargs that the entity can store for spawning children or w/e i am like 51% sure this is a good idea that i have, in the past, yearned for.

x unfuck the cursor

unfuck render layers
unfuck body/shape management
    Entity.add_body(*args, **kwargs):
        self.app.space.add(*args, **kwargs)
        self.bodies.append((args, kwargs))

    Entity.remove_bodies:
        for args, kwargs in self.bodies:
            self.app.space.remove(*args, **kwargs)

do hand hitboxes and equipment pickups
make equipment pickups show a controls popup when active?
    or just turn red?
    maybe the hand moves or blinks?

debug console
x    list entities in a pane
x    show player, camera location
    inspect entities
x    make unkillable
x    give bean/lore
    etc

x make the player pick up the sord at the start to start spawning happening

figure out the right way to do collision
    need to be able to quickly get any pair of entities that collided

boss 1

camera movement mechanics

geographical support conditions
    parameters for controlling spawning by location
    max number of <entity>
    scaling coefficients
    that kind of thing
    tunable parameters used by spawner entities to make
    spawn decisions that vary with position (of the camera)

spawner entities
    spawn enemies when within range of camera
    starting node spawners (and other later) conditional on player having weapon

    walk toward mouse if in window
    space for fast walk
