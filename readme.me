just playing around with a little walking simulator idea that happened to me the other day. obviously inspired by the likes of ginormo sword, sexy hiking, hammerfight, and probably something else i'm not thinking of right now.


this uses python with pymunk and pygame. setup.sh creates a directory called "stats" for saving stats and a python3 virtualenv called venv with pymunk and pygame installed. run.sh sources the venv and runs the game with some version information from git. if any of this is not to your liking (maybe you want to manage your dependencies differently, use a specific python installation, or run outside of a repo), you really just need a stats directory, pymunk, and pygame, and you can get there however you'd like. the setup and run scripts are very shrimple, so it shouldn't be difficult to make them to what you want (unless you just wanna do all the setup and stuff by hand).

there is something like keyboard support, but you really need a controller. this is just mapped to my xbox360 controller. at time of righting it's joystick and right trigger or cursor keys and spacebar (sic).
